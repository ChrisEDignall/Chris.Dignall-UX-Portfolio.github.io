    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>In an effort to find creative ways of promoting themselves to prospective students,
        the University of Chester contacted its school of Computer Science to ask for a study
      to be conducted as to the viability of creating a virtual reality tour of University Chapel,
    Chester.</p>
    <p> I was asked to conduct this study to discern the practicality of the project, and to garner the thoughts and
      feeling of the Alumni of the University of Chester, who have strong and fond memories of the chapel. </p>
      <p> My study explored how User Experience can be used in the creation of the virtual reality tour. </p>

          <h1>User test results</h1>
  <p>Usability testing was conducted with four of the five intended user testers,
    following user testing methodology (Nielsen, 1989). User interface
    interaction with the prototype was observed.</p>
 <p>The results were, as follows.</p>

 <p><b>User tester number 1, – computing student. (age = mid-30’s)</b></p>

<p>User tester 1, tapped the photo on intro screen, rather than the “START TOUR”
  option. They later noticed the start button and began using the application.
  This tester found the red back arrow (to turn around) confusing, saying they
  would prefer the words “turn around”. As a consequence of user tester 1 not
  turning around, they didn’t visit the choir loft. The tester found directional
  arrows confusing, as arrows have three points and thus point in three different
  directions.  When in categories the user stated that the absence of a back
  button, caused frustration. A return to the chapel option is recommended.
  The ornamental slider featured in the in the prototype appeared to confuse
  the user.</p>

<p><b>User tester number 2, law and politics student. (age = early 20’s)</b></p>

<p>User tester 2, tapped the image of the chapel rather than the “START TOUR”
  option. This user did not tap the red “turn around” icon. When this was
  pointed out to them at the end; they stated that they would prefer the words
  “turn around”. As the user never turned around, they never visited the choir
  loft. User tester 2 has never visited the Chapel in person. User tester 2 is
  aware of the chapel but has never visited the Chapel in person.</p>

<p><b>User tester number 3, young Psychology student. (age = early 20’s)</b></p>

<p>User tester 3 did not experience any great difficulty with the app. They were
  able to navigate with relative ease. User tester 2 is aware of the chapel but
  has never visited the Chapel in person.</p>

<p><b>User tester number 4, – retired school administrator. (age = 80’s)</b></p>

<p>User tester 4 has minor arthritis in her fingers. As a consequence, this user
  found the icons a little too small to use. User tester 4 learned how to use
  the app quickly and was able to view all windows and plaques. This user used
  the turned around function. However, this was more by accident than design as
  a consequence, user tester 4 was then able to access the choir loft. They then
  struggled to understand how to exit the choir loft again and return to the
  chapel floor. User tester 4 required clearer indications how to do this.</p>

<p><b>User tester number 5, – retired insurance sales rep. (age = early 70’s)</b></p>

<p>A fifth user tester was unable to participate due to the outbreak of Covid-19.
  For this reason, analysis of user testing results is based on only four
  observations. </p>

      <div class="paragraph">
        <h2>Prototype alterations to improve usability<h2>

      <h1>Start</h1>
      <p>The word ‘start’ is confusing, to clarify this it was changed to ‘START
        TOUR.</p>

      <h1>Arrows</h1>
      <p>•	Arrows were too small and difficult to hit. Users would have to hit
        the buttons several times before the prototype would transition to the
        next stage of the tour.</p>
      <p>•	The arrow pointing down was considered misleading. It implied that
        the user would take a step or two backwards (as it would when using Google
        Earth). In practice, the button turned the user around to face the other
        direction. The arrow down was changed so that the user can take a step
        backwards, for reasons of familiarity and intuitiveness. (Hodent, 2018).
        A new icon was created to indicate that the user wishes to turn around
        and go in the opposite direction. The increase in the size of the arrows
        is in keeping with Fitts Law.</p>

      <p>•	The ‘X’ in the top right-hand corner is problematic, when the user
        looked right or left. It implied that the user could return to where they
        were standing previously, walking either up or down the chapel. This led
        to the frustrating situation where users would, inadvertently end the
        tour and contravenes (Hodent, 2018), sixth pillar, error prevention and
        recovery. For this reason, the ‘X’ would be removed and replaced with an
        ‘END TOUR’ option. </p>
      <p>•	Prototype photographs were taken prior to a meeting with the chaplaincy
        and alumni. Some of the images, when looking right and left will be
        replaced with better quality images of the stained-glass windows, busts
        of significant people and plaques. The addition of, exclamation marks will
        lead to other screens providing historical data associated with the stain
        glass windows, busts and plaques. The removal of excessive and a confusing
        array of buttons is in keeping with Hicks Law.</p>

      <h1>Mobile devices</h1>
      <p>The images of the chapel may be small when viewed on a mobile phone. If the
      mobile phone was tilted onto its side, the screen would automatically
      readjust to show a larger picture, via screen autorotation. The prototype
      is built using InVision Studio, which does not include this functionality.
      A second prototype in landscape mode is represented using a diagram of how
      this function would work and look.</p>
