    <!-- Start User Testing - Remotely due to social isolation (COVID-19) -->
    <section class="RL-App" id="RugbyLeague">
    <div class="project__subtitle1">User Testing of Rugby League App - remote user testing
      - due to COVID-19 pandemic.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p> Because of the COVID-19 outbreak of Spring/Summer 2020, the user testing was conducted
      remotely with Neil and recorded on his smart phone.</p>
      <p>Neil used AZ screen recorder for his user testing, which was his choice. Sadly AZ screen recorder affected
        the responsivity of the buttons and appeared initially to indicate that buttons were not working or that
        the user could not press them. This was not the case. The user tester tried the prototype
        again without the AZ screen recorder running and reported all buttons worked as expected.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="project__subtitle1">Four key reflections from the user tester observations.
    </div>

<div class="paragraph">

    <p>The user tester appeared to perceive that clicking on the club badges accomplishes a function, that club badges
  direct him to information related to that club. At 2min & 22sec and 5min & 31sec he states: “So, the links at the top?
  The club badges?” & “If I click on this Catalans logo at the top? Nothing seems to be happening!”.
  In keeping with Don Norman’s real or perceived affordances, these graphics should therefore provide a link, be redesigned
  or be removed.</p>

  <p>On changing colour settings, the user tester commented, “Not sure”, at 2min & 56sec. On asking for clarification
    from the tester his response was that he wasn’t sure which type of colour blindness he has, so didn’t know which selection to make.
    This is something the observer could not anticipate in the design process.</p>

  <p>Where the user appears to be figuring out how the app works, he states, “Ah! So, I click on the game & it’s brought it up”,
    at 3min & 4sec. This response suggests that this element of the app design is in keeping with Krugs recommendation ‘UX design should
    be easy enough to understand that a user who has never seen the application before can look at it and think “Oh, it’s a _____”.’.</P>

  <p>This could be explained as an AZ screen recorder processing issue or the back button may be too small, contravening Fitts’ Law. </p>

      <div class="paragraph">
        <div class="project__subtitle1">Prototype alterations to improve usability
        </div>
        <h1> Key takeaways as a result of user testing</h1>
        <p>As a result of this analysis my recommendations for improvement include,
          the inclusion of a ‘Help’ option which the user tester stated would be
          beneficial. This recommendation is in line with Nielsen’s heuristic
          that help and documentation are necessary. Also, the size of the back
          button may need to be increased.</p>

      <p>Reassuringly, the user tester was able to quickly learn how to
          navigate the app, indicating it has been designed effectively with
          empathy for the end user ensuring that a person of average ability
          or experience is able to use it for its intended purpose, without
          frustration.</p>
